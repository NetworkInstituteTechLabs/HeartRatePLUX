2:					numberOfBeats	- number beats in PLUX signal to use to calculate a new avg BPM
30:					historyBPM		- number of BPM values that we record for avgBPM
25:					locPastBPM		- position of the past BPM around which the average pastBPM is calculated
5:					windowBPMloc	- number of values + and - around the previous variable, this determines the number of past BPMs used to calculated the pastBPM
5:					minBPMBaseline	- minimum number of recorded BPMs needed to calculated a Baseline BPM
1.0:				BPMfactor		- a factor to correct the BPM value
1.1:				highBPMThreshold- percentage that the current BPM needs to be higher then the Baseline or pastBPM to be considered HIGH
true:				oneBaseline		- flag to determine if we're using a one-time baseline (at step 1) or a running (pastBPM) value to test for a HIGH BPM
0:					beatsToSkip		- number of beats to ignore when starting to allows the signal to settle
80:					baseBPM			- Base BPM used in the beginning to get the beginning done properly
0.75:				lowThreshold	- if current BPM is lower than lowThreshold * prevBPM, then it's considered invalid
1.25:				highThreshold	- if current BPM is higher than highThreshold * prevBPM, then it's considered invalid
0.3:				valleyTest		- The minimum value a value has compared to the previous peak. Valley < 0.9 * prvPeak
0.6:				peakTest		- The maximum value a value has compared to the previous valley. Peak > 1.1 * prvValley
100:				scanCounter		- The number of Plux values to read at the beginning to find a true peak before starting BPM calculations
3:					maxInvalidBPM	- The number of consequetive invald BPM values before a new Prescan is done
100:				frequency		- Frequency of de Plux signal and processing
00-07-80-79-6F-D1:	Plux ID			- Unique MAC-address of the PLUX used, replace the : with -
1234:			Port
0:			Log bpm
0:			Log raw
RAW:			Send raw or bpm data 
1:			use TCP
